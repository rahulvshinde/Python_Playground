Questions on file-system traversal, log processing and APIs.

Write code to parse generic web logs and format it in different ways
First was a fizz buzz type question. Second and third were both log parsing

Last one was involved in Linkedin RESTful api calling and recursion

fizz buzz, export to CSV, pull some stuff out of logs and count it.

Take part of a log file, export to CSV

wanted me to solve a pretty messy problem processing a spreadsheet input with an online algorithm in python to print a set of tables using maps it in linear time,.


How do you write a regular expression for some silly pattern in Python

Write a program which prints out all numbers between 1 and 100. When the program would print out a number exactly divisible by 4, print "Linked" instead. When it would print out a number exactly divisible by 6, print "In" instead. When it would print out a number exactly divisible by both 4 and 6, print "LinkedIn."

Parse a log except, providing a csv of the count of each proc per DTTM.
